All this code is kind of unnecessary, since Java comes with the
javax.sounds.midi.MidiSystem package already. See
../overtone-tutorial/midi/midi_player.clj for code that uses that package to
parse a MIDI file and creates Song/Track/Event records. That code ignores
MIDI channel, but it would be easly to add channel to each Event.

This code is still worthwhile because it distinguishes between the different
kinds of events and that other code doesn't yet do that. But it will.
