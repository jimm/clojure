Experimentation with Clojure.

4clojure.clj contains my solutions to the http://www.4clojure.com/
programming challenges.

bin/clj is a REPL startup script (though I use
https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/ these days).

The midi subdir contains an app that uses midi-clj
(http://github.com/overtone/midi-clj).

cloplayer is an Apache log file replayer.
