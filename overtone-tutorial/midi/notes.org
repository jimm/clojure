* Ideas

- At start of play give metronome to song. Let tempo in meta-track modify
  metronome tempo.

- Map track (by name?) + channel to instrument
  - At play time

- Load raw messages
  - Except note off; add duration to note on message

- Use raw Java Sequence with wrapper methods instead of defining records?

* Limitations / Bugs

- Does not calculate tempo at all; MIDI tick == milliseconds

- Assumes one channel per track, ignores channel
